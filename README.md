# Snakes!

Multi player snake game implemented on HackKRK Geek Game Contest (31.01.2013).

Won 1st place by popular acclaim :)

## Usage

To start the server, run:

    lein run

To play, connect to the server via telnet:

    telnet <server ip> 6666

It should be possible to connect via any telnet client supporting the Telnet Protocol (works with default clients on Ubuntu, Mac OS and Windows XP). It will not work with clients that do not support NAWS (getting terminal window size), which rules out most of the so called "telnet clients" for tablets.
